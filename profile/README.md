## ✨ About us

The Oxford Research Software Engineering Group at the University of Oxford collaborates with researchers to develop high-quality software solutions tailored to the specific needs of their research projects and provides training to equip researchers with essential software engineering skills.

Our team offers expertise across a broad range of research support areas, including:

- 💻 Research software development
- ⚙️ Setting up development infrastructure (version control, testing frameworks, continuous integration)
- 📐 Advising on best practices in research software engineering
- 🔎 Conducting in-depth code reviews
- 🎓 Delivering tailored training aligned with your research goals

Explore our [portfolio](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/projects) to discover the projects we’ve completed or are currently working on. You can also [meet our team](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/people), learn about their expertise 🧠, and see the diverse experience they can bring to your project.

## 🤝 Collaboration with OxRSE

If you are interested in collaborating with OxRSE, we encourage you to [get in touch 📩](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/contact). Research Software Engineers from OxRSE will be able to discuss software-related aspects of your project and provide expert advice on software or infrastructure plans.

## 🌟 Project of the Month: Gutenberg

![Gutenberg](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/sites/default/files/styles/mt_image_large/public/rse/images/media/gutenberg_banner_1.png?itok=GyqJyMa7)

[Gutenberg](https://www.rse.ox.ac.uk/gutenberg) is an **open source research and teaching platform** developed by the Oxford Research Software Engineering Group (OxRSE) at the University of Oxford as part of the [UNIVERSE-HPC](https://www.universe-hpc.ac.uk/) project.

It provides an environment for hosting training materials in a structured, pathway-based style, offering a visual interface for browsing the various sections of training content and viewing them.
A course management interface allows trainers to create a course syllabus based on materials set up within the system and then to make this available to students. Details of modules completed and results of exercises and challenges within the training material are collated and made available to course leaders to enable them to keep track of student progress.

A hosted deployment of Gutenberg is available at https://train.rse.ox.ac.uk; self-hosting is also possible.
